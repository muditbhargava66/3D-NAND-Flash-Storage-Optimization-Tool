## Installation
1. Ensure that you have Python 3.7 or above installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-nand-optimization-tool.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 3d-nand-optimization-tool
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration
The 3D NAND Optimization Tool relies on two configuration files: `config.yaml` and `template.yaml`. These files allow you to customize various aspects of the tool's behavior and specify the desired optimization settings.

### config.yaml
The `config.yaml` file contains the main configuration settings for the tool. It is located in the `resources/config/` directory. The file is divided into several sections, each controlling a specific aspect of the tool:

- `nand_config`: Specifies the NAND flash configuration, including page size, block size, number of blocks, and number of planes.
- `optimization_config`: Configures the optimization techniques, such as error correction algorithm, compression level, caching policy, and parallelism settings.
- `firmware_config`: Sets the firmware-related configurations, including firmware version, read retry, and data scrambling options.
- `characterization_config`: Specifies the NAND characterization settings, such as sample size, erase threshold, and data retention time.
- `logging`: Configures the logging behavior, including log level, log file path, maximum log file size, and backup count.
- `ui_config`: Sets the user interface preferences, such as theme, font size, and window size.

To modify the configuration, open the `config.yaml` file in a text editor and adjust the values according to your requirements. Save the file after making the desired changes.

### template.yaml
The `template.yaml` file serves as a template for generating the firmware specification. It is located in the `resources/config/` directory. The file contains placeholders that are replaced with actual values from the `config.yaml` file during the firmware specification generation process.

The placeholders in the `template.yaml` file correspond to the configuration settings in the `config.yaml` file. For example, `{{ firmware_version }}` will be replaced with the actual firmware version specified in the `config.yaml` file.

You can customize the `template.yaml` file to match your specific firmware requirements. Modify the file in a text editor, adding or removing placeholders as needed, and save the changes.

## Usage
The 3D NAND Optimization Tool can be used through either a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI).

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
To run the tool with the GUI, use the following command:
```
python src/main.py --gui
```

The GUI window will open, providing an intuitive interface to interact with the tool. The main window consists of a menu bar and a central widget displaying the optimization results.

- Use the "File" menu to load NAND flash data, save optimized data, and exit the application.
- Use the "Settings" menu to open the settings dialog and modify the configuration.
- The optimization results will be displayed in the central widget, showing various metrics and statistics.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
To run the tool in CLI mode, use the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```

The tool will execute the optimization process based on the configuration specified in the `config.yaml` file. Progress and results will be logged to the console and the log file specified in the configuration.

You can customize the behavior of the CLI mode by modifying the `main()` function in the `src/main.py` file. Implement your desired CLI functionality, such as parsing command-line arguments, displaying results, or saving data to files.

## Optimization Techniques
The 3D NAND Optimization Tool employs various optimization techniques to enhance the performance, reliability, and efficiency of NAND flash storage systems.

### NAND Defect Handling
- Error Correction: Utilizes algorithms like BCH or LDPC to detect and correct bit errors in NAND flash pages.
- Bad Block Management: Identifies and handles blocks that have become unreliable or have reached their end of life.
- Wear Leveling: Evenly distributes write and erase operations across the NAND flash to minimize wear on individual blocks.

### Performance Optimization
- Data Compression: Reduces the amount of data written to the NAND flash, improving write performance and extending the lifespan of the storage medium.
- Caching: Stores frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for repeated NAND flash reads and enhancing read performance.
- Parallel Access: Leverages the inherent parallelism of NAND flash to perform concurrent read and write operations on different planes or dies.

### Firmware Integration
- Firmware Specification Generation: Generates firmware specifications based on predefined templates and configurations, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.
- Test Benches: Validates the correctness and reliability of the firmware through a set of test cases and scenarios.
- Validation Scripts: Performs additional checks and validations on the firmware to ensure its integrity and functionality.

### NAND Characterization
- Data Collection: Gathers relevant data from NAND flash devices, including page data, block metadata, and error correction information.
- Data Analysis: Analyzes the collected data to extract meaningful insights, such as erase count distribution, error rates, and performance metrics.
- Data Visualization: Generates visual representations of the analyzed data to facilitate interpretation and decision-making.
