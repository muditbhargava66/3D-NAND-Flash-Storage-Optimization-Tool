# NAND Defect Handling

NAND flash memories are prone to various types of defects, including bit errors, bad blocks, and wear-related issues. The NAND Defect Handling module addresses these challenges through sophisticated error correction, bad block management, and wear leveling techniques.

## Error Correction

### BCH Implementation

The tool implements the BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) error correction code algorithm, which is particularly effective for NAND flash memory due to its ability to correct random bit errors efficiently.

- **Galois Field Arithmetic**: Implements finite field operations required for BCH encoding and decoding
- **Dynamic Parameterization**: Configurable parameters (m and t) to adjust error correction strength
- **Core Algorithms**:
  - Generator polynomial calculation for encoding
  - Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for finding error locator polynomials
  - Chien search for determining error locations
  - Polynomial arithmetic for GF(2^m) operations

The BCH implementation is optimized for NAND flash requirements with particular attention to:
- Memory efficiency for embedded applications
- Performance optimizations for common field sizes
- Caching of frequently used calculations (polynomial operations)
- Proper handling of corner cases and error conditions

### LDPC Implementation

For applications requiring higher error correction capabilities, the tool implements LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) codes:

- **Matrix Generation**: Progressive Edge-Growth (PEG) algorithm for generating optimized parity-check matrices
- **Systematic Code Support**: Conversion to systematic form for efficient encoding
- **Belief Propagation Decoding**: Implementaton of message-passing algorithm for soft-decision decoding
- **Configurable Parameters**:
  - Code rate adjustment (n, d_v, d_c parameters)
  - Matrix sparsity control
  - Iteration limits for decoding

The LDPC implementation provides near-Shannon-limit error correction performance, making it suitable for high-density 3D NAND flash with elevated error rates.

### Unified Error Correction Interface

Both BCH and LDPC are accessible through a unified `ECCHandler` interface, which:

- Provides consistent encode/decode methods regardless of the underlying algorithm
- Supports detection of uncorrectable errors
- Handles different data types (bytes, arrays, NumPy arrays)
- Offers detailed error reporting
- Adjusts dynamically based on configuration parameters

## Bad Block Management

### Bad Block Table

The module maintains an efficient bad block table to track blocks that have been marked as bad:

- **Runtime Detection**: Marks blocks as bad when operations fail or errors exceed correction capabilities
- **Factory Bad Block Handling**: Detects and loads factory-marked bad blocks during initialization
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves bad block information in reserved blocks for recovery after power loss
- **Efficient Implementation**: Uses bit arrays for compact storage and fast lookup
- **Block Range Validation**: Prevents access to out-of-range blocks

### Block Replacement Strategies

When a bad block is encountered, several strategies are employed:

- **Next Good Block Finding**: Efficient algorithm to locate the nearest available good block
- **Reserved Block Pool**: Dedicated replacement blocks for critical areas
- **Skip List**: Fast traversal of known bad blocks
- **Wrap-Around Handling**: Proper management when reaching the end of the device

### Error Detection and Handling

The module includes sophisticated mechanisms to detect block failures:

- **Write Failure Detection**: Identifies patterns that indicate imminent block failure during write operations
- **Erase Failure Handling**: Detects blocks that fail to erase properly
- **Read Disturbance Monitoring**: Tracks read errors that may indicate neighboring block issues
- **Verification**: Post-operation validation to ensure data integrity

## Wear Leveling

### Wear Tracking

The module tracks erase counts for each block to monitor wear patterns:

- **Erase Counter**: Maintains count of erase operations per block
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates min, max, average, and standard deviation of wear
- **Wear Distribution Visualization**: Tools for visualizing wear patterns across the device
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves wear information in reserved blocks for recovery after power loss

### Wear Leveling Algorithms

Several wear leveling approaches are implemented:

- **Static Wear Leveling**: Periodically relocates static data from less-worn to more-worn blocks
- **Dynamic Wear Leveling**: Maps logical blocks to physical blocks based on wear levels
- **Hot/Cold Data Separation**: Identifies frequently and infrequently changed data for optimal placement
- **Wear Threshold Detection**: Automatic triggering of wear leveling when thresholds are exceeded

### Block Data Swapping

When wear leveling is triggered, the module efficiently moves data between blocks:

- **Data Preservation**: Ensures data integrity during relocation
- **Atomic Operations**: Prevents data loss if interruptions occur during swapping
- **Metadata Update**: Properly updates all mapping tables after swapping
- **Wear Update**: Adjusts wear level tracking after block swaps

## Integration with NAND Controller

The NAND Defect Handling module integrates tightly with the NAND Controller:

- **Transparent Operation**: Error correction and bad block management happen automatically during read/write operations
- **Configurable Behavior**: Easily adjustable parameters via configuration files
- **Logging and Statistics**: Comprehensive logging and statistics for monitoring and debugging
- **Performance Optimization**: Designed to minimize overhead while maximizing protection

## Component Interaction

The module components work together to provide comprehensive defect handling:

1. **ECCHandler**: Uses either BCH or LDPC based on configuration to:
   - Encode data during writes with parity information
   - Decode and correct errors during reads
   - Determine if data is correctable or beyond repair

2. **BadBlockManager**: Maintains a bad block table and provides:
   - Methods to mark blocks as bad when errors exceed correction capabilities
   - Efficient lookup of bad block status
   - Functions to find the next available good block

3. **WearLevelingEngine**: Tracks block usage and:
   - Monitors erase counts per block
   - Determines when wear leveling should occur
   - Implements mechanisms to redistribute wear

This integrated approach ensures robust handling of the inherent reliability challenges in 3D NAND flash memory, extending device lifetime and improving data integrity.
