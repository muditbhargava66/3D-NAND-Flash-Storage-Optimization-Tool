# NAND Defect Handling

NAND flash memories are prone to various types of defects, such as bit errors, bad blocks, and wear-related issues. The NAND Defect Handling module addresses these challenges through the following techniques:

## Error Correction
- Implements error correction algorithms, such as BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) or LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check), to detect and correct bit errors in NAND flash pages.
- Encodes data with error correction codes before writing to the NAND flash and decodes data during read operations to identify and correct errors.
- Provides configurable parameters for error correction strength and code size.

## Bad Block Management
- Maintains a bad block table to keep track of blocks that have been marked as bad due to manufacturing defects or runtime failures.
- Provides methods to mark a block as bad and check if a block is bad.
- Implements strategies for handling bad blocks, such as skipping them during write operations and replacing them with spare blocks.

## Wear Leveling
- Implements wear leveling algorithms to evenly distribute write and erase operations across the NAND flash blocks.
- Keeps track of the erase count and wear level of each block.
- Dynamically remaps logical block addresses to physical block addresses to balance the wear across the NAND flash.
- Provides configurable parameters for wear leveling thresholds and algorithms.

The NAND Defect Handling module integrates with the NAND Controller to provide a reliable and robust storage system. It abstracts the complexities of error correction, bad block management, and wear leveling from higher-level modules, allowing them to focus on their specific functionalities.
