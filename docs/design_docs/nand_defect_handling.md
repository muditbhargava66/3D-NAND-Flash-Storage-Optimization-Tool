# NAND Defect Handling

NAND flash memories are prone to various types of defects, such as bit errors, bad blocks, and wear-related issues. The NAND Defect Handling module addresses these challenges through the following techniques:

## Error Correction
- Implements error correction algorithms, such as BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) or LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check), to detect and correct bit errors in NAND flash pages.
- The `bch.py` and `ldpc.py` files provide the implementations of the BCH and LDPC algorithms, respectively.
- The `error_correction.py` file integrates these algorithms into the error correction flow, handling the encoding and decoding of data.
- Supports configurable parameters for error correction strength and code size.

## Bad Block Management
- Maintains a bad block table to keep track of blocks that have been marked as bad due to manufacturing defects or runtime failures.
- Provides methods to mark a block as bad and check if a block is bad.
- Implements strategies for handling bad blocks, such as skipping them during write operations and replacing them with spare blocks.
- The `bad_block_management.py` file contains the implementation of the bad block management functionality.

## Wear Leveling
- Implements wear leveling algorithms to evenly distribute write and erase operations across the NAND flash blocks.
- Keeps track of the erase count and wear level of each block.
- Dynamically remaps logical block addresses to physical block addresses to balance the wear across the NAND flash.
- Provides configurable parameters for wear leveling thresholds and algorithms.
- The `wear_leveling.py` file contains the implementation of the wear leveling functionality.

The NAND Defect Handling module integrates with the NAND Controller to provide a reliable and robust storage system. It abstracts the complexities of error correction, bad block management, and wear leveling from higher-level modules, allowing them to focus on their specific functionalities.

The module utilizes the configuration settings specified in the `config.yaml` file to customize its behavior. The configuration includes parameters such as error correction algorithm, BCH and LDPC parameters, bad block thresholds, and wear leveling thresholds.

Logging is employed to capture important events, errors, and progress related to NAND defect handling. The logging configuration is specified in the `config.yaml` file and utilized by the logger module.

The NAND Defect Handling module is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the integration of new error correction algorithms or bad block management strategies in the future.

By effectively handling NAND defects, the module ensures the reliability and longevity of the NAND flash storage system, minimizing data loss and maximizing the usable capacity of the storage device.
