  - Integrates with the NAND defect handling, performance optimization, and firmware integration modules
  - Handles data loading, saving, and retrieval operations
  - Generates optimization results and statistics
  - Manages the flow of operations through the entire system
  - Automatically applies optimizations in the appropriate sequence

- **Address Translation**
  - Translates logical block addresses to physical block addresses
  - Handles remapping of blocks for wear leveling and bad block management
  - Maintains consistent mapping even across system restarts

## Data Flow

The typical data flow through the system follows this pattern:

### 1. Configuration Initialization
- System loads and parses configuration from `config.yaml`
- Components initialize with their specific settings
- Firmware specifications are generated and validated

### 2. Read Operations
- Request arrives at NAND Controller
- Caching layer checks for data in memory
- If not cached, parallel access coordinates the read operation
- Bad block management confirms block validity
- ECC decodes and corrects any errors
- Decompression restores original data
- Data is returned to caller and optionally cached

### 3. Write Operations
- Data arrives at NAND Controller
- Compression reduces data size
- ECC encodes data with error correction codes
- Wear leveling selects optimal physical location
- Bad block management verifies block usability
- Parallel access coordinates the write operation
- Cache is updated with new data

### 4. Optimization and Analysis
- NAND Characterization monitors system behavior
- Performance metrics are collected and analyzed
- Firmware parameters are tuned based on analysis
- Results are presented through the UI
