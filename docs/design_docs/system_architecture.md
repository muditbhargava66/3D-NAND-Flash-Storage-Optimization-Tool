# System Architecture

The 3D NAND Optimization Tool follows a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes extensibility. The system is divided into several key components:

## NAND Controller
- Serves as the central component that orchestrates the interaction between different modules.
- Provides an interface for reading, writing, and erasing NAND flash pages and blocks.
- Integrates with the NAND defect handling, performance optimization, and firmware integration modules.
- Handles data loading, saving, and retrieval operations.
- Generates optimization results and statistics.

## NAND Defect Handling
- Handles error correction using algorithms such as BCH or LDPC.
- Manages bad blocks by maintaining a bad block table and providing methods for marking and checking bad blocks.
- Implements wear leveling techniques to evenly distribute write/erase cycles across the NAND flash.

## Performance Optimization
- Applies data compression techniques to reduce the amount of data written to the NAND flash.
- Implements a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.
- Utilizes parallel access techniques to optimize read and write operations.

## Firmware Integration
- Generates firmware specifications based on predefined templates and configurations.
- Provides test benches for validating firmware functionality and performance.
- Includes scripts for firmware validation and testing.

## NAND Characterization
- Collects and analyzes NAND flash characteristics data, such as erase count distribution and bad block trends.
- Generates visualizations and reports to provide insights into NAND flash behavior and performance.

## User Interface
- Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring optimization settings and monitoring the optimization process.
- Allows users to initiate optimization tasks, view progress, and access optimization results.

## Utilities
- Includes utility modules for configuration management, logging, file handling, and NAND device interfacing.

The modular architecture allows for easy maintenance, testing, and extension of the system. Each component has a well-defined responsibility and communicates with other components through clear interfaces.

The system leverages configuration files (`config.yaml` and `template.yaml`) to customize the behavior and parameters of different modules. The configuration files are loaded and processed by the respective modules to adapt their functionality accordingly.

Logging is employed throughout the system to capture important events, errors, and progress information. The logging configuration is specified in the `config.yaml` file and utilized by the logger module.

The GUI serves as the main entry point for users to interact with the tool. It communicates with the NAND Controller to initiate optimization tasks, retrieve results, and update the displayed information.

Overall, the modular and configurable architecture of the 3D NAND Optimization Tool enables efficient optimization of NAND flash storage systems while providing flexibility and extensibility for future enhancements.
