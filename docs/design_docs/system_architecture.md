# System Architecture

The 3D NAND Optimization Tool follows a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes extensibility. The system is divided into several key components:

## NAND Controller
- Serves as the central component that orchestrates the interaction between different modules.
- Provides an interface for reading, writing, and erasing NAND flash pages and blocks.
- Integrates with the NAND defect handling, performance optimization, and firmware integration modules.

## NAND Defect Handling
- Handles error correction using algorithms such as BCH or LDPC.
- Manages bad blocks by maintaining a bad block table and providing methods for marking and checking bad blocks.
- Implements wear leveling techniques to evenly distribute write/erase cycles across the NAND flash.

## Performance Optimization
- Applies data compression techniques to reduce the amount of data written to the NAND flash.
- Implements a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.
- Utilizes parallel access techniques to optimize read and write operations.

## Firmware Integration
- Generates firmware specifications based on predefined templates and configurations.
- Provides test benches for validating firmware functionality and performance.
- Includes scripts for firmware validation and testing.

## NAND Characterization
- Collects and analyzes NAND flash characteristics data, such as erase count distribution and bad block trends.
- Generates visualizations and reports to provide insights into NAND flash behavior and performance.

## User Interface
- Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring optimization settings and monitoring the optimization process.
- Allows users to initiate optimization tasks, view progress, and access optimization results.

## Utilities
- Includes utility modules for configuration management, logging, file handling, and NAND device interfacing.

The modular architecture allows for easy maintenance, testing, and extension of the system. Each component has a well-defined responsibility and communicates with other components through clear interfaces.
