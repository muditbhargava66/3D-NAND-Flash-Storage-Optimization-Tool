# Performance Optimization

The Performance Optimization module aims to enhance the performance of the 3D NAND storage system through various techniques:

## Data Compression
- Applies data compression algorithms, such as LZ4 or Zstandard, to reduce the size of data before writing it to the NAND flash.
- Decompresses data during read operations to restore the original content.
- Provides configurable parameters for compression level and algorithm selection.
- Helps reduce write amplification and improves the overall write performance.

## Caching
- Implements a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster read access.
- Utilizes a cache replacement policy, such as Least Recently Used (LRU), to manage the cache efficiently.
- Provides configurable parameters for cache size and eviction policies.
- Enhances read performance by reducing the need for NAND flash access for frequently accessed data.

## Parallel Access
- Utilizes parallel access techniques to optimize read and write operations on the NAND flash.
- Implements a multi-threaded approach to perform concurrent read and write operations on different NAND flash planes or dies.
- Provides configurable parameters for the number of parallel threads and resource management.
- Improves overall throughput and reduces latency for read and write operations.

The Performance Optimization module integrates with the NAND Controller and works in conjunction with the NAND Defect Handling module to provide a high-performance and efficient storage system. It transparently applies compression, caching, and parallel access techniques to enhance the performance of read and write operations.
